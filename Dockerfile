# Stage 1: The Build Stage (Uses a full JDK to compile the code and build the JAR)
# We use a base image with Java Development Kit (JDK) and Maven pre-installed
FROM maven:3.9.8-jdk-21 AS build

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the pom.xml and source code into the container
# Copying pom first helps Docker cache the dependencies if only the code changes
COPY pom.xml .
COPY src ./src

# Build the application (This executes 'mvn clean install' just like in Jenkins)
# The result is a JAR file in the target/ directory
RUN mvn clean install -DskipTests

# Find the name of your compiled JAR file.
# It usually follows the pattern: <artifactId>-<version>.jar
# Assuming your pom.xml artifactId is 'scientific-calculator' and version is '1.0-SNAPSHOT'
# Replace the artifact name if yours is different!
ENV ARTIFACT_NAME="SciCalc-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar"

# Stage 2: The Runtime Stage (Uses a minimal JRE to run the application)
# This uses a much smaller image that only contains the Java Runtime Environment (JRE)
FROM openjdk:21-slim-buster

# Set the working directory where the application will run
WORKDIR /usr/app

# Copy the generated JAR file from the 'build' stage to this runtime stage
COPY --from=build /app/target/${ARTIFACT_NAME} app.jar

# Define the command to run the application when the container starts.
# This explicitly tells Java to run your specific Main class.
